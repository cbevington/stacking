Individual READMEs are available in each directory. Directory breakdown:

-cluster_catalogs: 		real catalogs used for pseudo tidal tensor stacks
-COOP_stacking:			.ini files and outputted stacks from COOP
-pseudo_tidal_tensor_stacking:	code that does a discrete nabla^-2 di dj on real cluster data, then stacks

NOTE: maps for COOP_stacking are found on my SciNet (scratch2/r/rbond/cbevingt/maps)
